    <h2> Why are bears so awesome?!? Just Beacuse.</h2>

        <p>At this point, I think we can all agree that bears are just the best. Here are some bear thoughts from: https://helloiamabear.com/</p>


      <h3>Bear Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Since I have no way to determine if I am good at being a bear, I really have no way to determine if I should have progressed in my bearness. I have never gotten any kind of clue or indication that I should be getting better at being a bear over some period of time. Should I be a better bear each day? Each year? Is my progress meant to be incremental or something that should be obvious and very easily noticeable?  </p>
        <p>Or, maybe, I am not supposed to become a better bear. There is a chance that my bearness is not meant to grow. Maybe I am a bear, and I am supposed to be just the bear I am. Not a better one. Not a worse one. Just one, single bear that I already am until I am not a bear anymore.  </p>
